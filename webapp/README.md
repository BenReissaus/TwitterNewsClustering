### **Visualization of the clustering**

To get an overview about the clustering results, we created a little webapp. The webpage shows for every cluster (y-axis) and every batch (x-axis) the cluster count, a cluster representative and the silhouette score. 

Even more detailed information about a single cluster can be found by clicking on the cluster count.
